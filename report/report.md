## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of a comprehensive feature-level comparison between **Get Shit Done (GSD)** v1.50.0-canary.0 and **Big Powers** v1.14.0. The goal is to identify GSD features that are missing or underdeveloped in Big Powers, prioritize them by impact and effort, and recommend a concrete integration roadmap.

**Key findings:**

- **74 distinct gaps** were identified across **17 categories**.
- **Big Powers** excels at its core mission: spec-driven, test-first development for solo developers, with a clean 42+ skill architecture, hard gates, and a PMBOK-inspired lifecycle.
- **GSD** is a broader system: it adds multi-agent orchestration (33 agent roles, 88 workflows), a structured `.planning/` artifact system, advanced execution models (wave-based parallelism, cross-AI delegation, failure-tier escalation), a comprehensive hook system, security hardening, and a full SDK/CLI layer.
- The highest-value, lowest-effort wins are in **context engineering** (context window monitoring, learning store), **quality assurance** (node repair operator, verification debt tracking), and **phase management** (dynamic phase modification, quick mode).
- The highest-impact but higher-effort opportunities are in **multi-agent orchestration** (specialized agent roles, fresh context per agent) and **advanced execution models** (wave-based parallelism, cross-AI delegation).

**Bottom line:** Big Powers has a strong foundation. The recommended approach is to adopt GSD's context engineering and quality assurance features first (quick wins), then incrementally introduce multi-agent orchestration patterns and advanced execution models.

### 1.2 What Big Powers Does Better

Before diving into gaps, it's important to acknowledge areas where Big Powers is equal or superior:

- **Hard gates and safety:** Big Powers' `guard-git` and explicit HARD GATE pattern are more opinionated and safer than GSD's approach.
- **TDD enforcement:** `develop-tdd` with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR is more rigorous than GSD's execution model.
- **Self-review:** `audit-code` with its 8-dimension checklist and Clean Code Heuristics is more thorough than GSD's code review pipeline.
- **Impact analysis:** `assess-impact` with blast radius analysis is more structured than GSD's approach.
- **WSJF prioritization:** Built into `plan-release` and `change-request`; GSD has no equivalent.
- **Boy Scout Rule enforcement:** Explicit in `audit-code`; not present in GSD.
- **Simplicity:** Big Powers' 42 skills with "one skill, one thing" is more maintainable than GSD's 88 workflows.

## 2. Gap Analysis

### 2.1 Prioritization Framework

Gaps are prioritized using a simplified WSJF-like model:

- **Impact:** How much would this improve Big Powers' capabilities? (1-10)
- **Effort:** How complex is this to implement? (1-10, where 10 = months of work)
- **Priority Score:** Impact / Effort (higher = implement sooner)

## 3. Category-Level Analysis

### 3.1 Context Engineering (5 gaps)

**Current state:** Big Powers uses `specs/` for artifacts and `terse-mode` for token economy. No context window monitoring or budgeting.

**Assessment:** This is the highest-leverage category. Context rot and context overflow are primary failure modes in long-running agent sessions. GSD's approach of monitoring context utilization and automatically thinning prompts is directly applicable.

**Recommendation:** Implement context window monitoring as an extension to `orchestrate`. Add a `specs/CONTEXT.md` per phase for implementation decisions. Create a `specs/LEARNINGS.md` for cross-phase knowledge accumulation.

### 3.2 Quality Assurance (7 gaps)

**Current state:** Big Powers has strong QA via `audit-code`, `enforce-first`, `request-review`, and `validate-fix`. However, it lacks automated node repair, verification debt tracking, and health validation.

**Assessment:** The node repair operator is the most impactful gap here. Currently, when a task's verify command fails during `execute-plan`, the user must manually intervene. Auto-retry with diagnosis would significantly reduce friction.

**Recommendation:** Extend `execute-plan` with a node repair operator that auto-diagnoses common failure modes (missing dependency, syntax error, test failure) and attempts fixes before escalating.

### 3.3 Phase Management (6 gaps)

**Current state:** Big Powers' `orchestrate` coordinates phases well, but lacks dynamic phase modification, quick mode, pause/resume, and auto-advance.

**Assessment:** Quick mode and auto-advance are the most practical additions. Not every task needs the full lifecycle, and reducing cognitive load for routine progressions would improve the user experience.

**Recommendation:** Add a `--quick` flag to `orchestrate` that skips research and plan-check gates. Extend `survey-context` with `--next` to auto-advance.

### 3.4 Multi-Agent Orchestration (4 gaps)

**Current state:** Big Powers has `delegate-task` and `dispatch-agents` for spawning subagents, but no predefined agent roles, no fresh context guarantee, and no thin orchestrator pattern formalization.

**Assessment:** This is the largest architectural gap. GSD's 33 agent roles with focused tool sets and model assignments represent a mature multi-agent system. However, adopting all 33 roles is overkill for Big Powers' solo-developer focus.

**Recommendation:** Start with 5 core agent roles: `code-reviewer`, `security-auditor`, `doc-writer`, `bug-investigator`, and `researcher`. Define each with a focused tool set and recommended model. Formalize the thin orchestrator pattern in `orchestrate`.

### 3.5 Execution Models (5 gaps)

**Current state:** `execute-plan` runs sequentially; `dispatch-agents` runs in parallel but lacks wave analysis. No autonomous mode, no cross-AI delegation, no failure-tier escalation.

**Assessment:** Wave-based parallelism is the most impactful addition. Grouping independent tasks and running them in parallel would significantly speed up execution for phases with many independent stories.

**Recommendation:** Add dependency analysis to `execute-plan` that groups independent tasks into waves. Each wave runs in parallel; waves run sequentially.

### 3.6 Security & Hardening (4 gaps)

**Current state:** `guard-git` blocks destructive operations. No secret scanning, package legitimacy checking, or prompt injection detection.

**Assessment:** Secret scanning and read-before-edit guard are the most practical security additions. Secret scanning prevents accidental credential commits; read-before-edit prevents accidental code corruption.

**Recommendation:** Add a pre-commit secret scan (base64 detection, common patterns). Add a read-before-edit check to `guard-git`.

### 3.7 Remaining Categories (10 categories, 33 gaps)

The remaining categories (Project Management, Brownfield, UI/UX, SDK/CLI, Installer, Hooks, Documentation, Testing, Developer Profiling, Configuration) contain gaps that are generally lower priority for Big Powers' core solo-developer use case. They become relevant if Big Powers expands to team/multi-project scenarios or aims for broader runtime support.

## 4. Recommended Integration Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal:** Add context engineering and quality quick wins.

1. Extend `orchestrate` with context window monitoring and auto-thinning
2. Add `specs/CONTEXT.md` per phase for implementation decisions
3. Extend `execute-plan` with node repair operator (auto-retry on verify failure)
4. Add verification debt tracking to `specs/STATE.md`
5. Add health validation command for `specs/` artifact consistency
6. Add configurable granularity to `plan-release`

**Expected outcome:** 15-20% reduction in failed sessions due to context overflow; 30% reduction in manual intervention during execution.

### Phase 2 — Acceleration (Weeks 5-8)

**Goal:** Add execution speed improvements and phase management.

1. Add `--quick` flag to `orchestrate` for lightweight tasks
2. Extend `survey-context` with `--next` auto-advance
3. Add wave-based parallelism to `execute-plan`
4. Add dynamic phase modification to `plan-release`
5. Formalize pause/resume in `orchestrate`

**Expected outcome:** 40% faster execution for phases with independent tasks; better UX for small tasks.

### Phase 3 — Multi-Agent (Weeks 9-14)

**Goal:** Introduce specialized agent roles and orchestration patterns.

1. Define 5 core agent roles (code-reviewer, security-auditor, doc-writer, bug-investigator, researcher)
2. Formalize thin orchestrator pattern in `orchestrate`
3. Add fresh context guarantee to `delegate-task`
4. Extend `request-review` with plan review convergence loop
5. Add per-phase model selection to `orchestrate`

**Expected outcome:** Higher-quality multi-agent workflows; better plan quality through convergence.

### Phase 4 — Hardening (Weeks 15-18)

**Goal:** Add security and production-readiness features.

1. Add secret scanning (base64 + common patterns) to pre-commit hooks
2. Add read-before-edit guard to `guard-git`
3. Add security audit skill with dependency scanning
4. Add milestone lifecycle commands to `release-branch`
5. Add a centralized template library

**Expected outcome:** Reduced security risk; better milestone tracking.

### Phase 5 — Strategic (Weeks 19+)

**Goal:** Long-term strategic capabilities.

1. Cross-AI execution delegation protocol
2. Failure-tier model escalation
3. Multi-runtime support expansion
4. SDK design for programmatic integration
5. Developer profiling and stats dashboard

**Expected outcome:** Broader runtime support; automatic model optimization; programmatic integration.

## 5. Risk Assessment

### 5.1 Integration Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Skill bloat — adding too many skills dilutes the "one skill, one thing" principle | High | Medium | Consolidate related features into umbrella skills; keep the total count under 60 |
| Token overhead — context monitoring and multi-agent features increase token usage | Medium | High | Use profile-based skill loading; disable monitoring for small projects |
| Complexity creep — wave-based execution and cross-AI delegation add significant complexity | Medium | Medium | Implement incrementally; start with sequential execution, add waves as an opt-in |
| Maintenance burden — 74 gaps is a large backlog; trying to close all at once will stall | High | High | Follow the phased roadmap; close 10-15 gaps per quarter |
| User confusion — too many modes and flags overwhelm solo developers | Medium | Medium | Sensible defaults; advanced features behind `--advanced` flags |

### 5.2 What NOT to Integrate

Some GSD features are not a good fit for Big Powers:

- **88 workflow files:** Big Powers' skill-per-feature model is more maintainable than GSD's workflow library approach.
- **15-runtime support:** Big Powers targets Gemini Extension and Claude Code. Expanding to 15 runtimes is not aligned with its focus.
- **Full SDK:** A TypeScript SDK makes sense for GSD's programmatic use case but is overkill for Big Powers' skill-based model.
- **569+ test files:** Big Powers is a skill system, not a CLI tool. It doesn't need its own test suite at that scale.
- **Manager dashboard:** Big Powers is designed for solo developers. Multi-project management is out of scope.

## 6. Conclusion

Big Powers v1.14.0 is a well-architected skill system for spec-driven, test-first development by solo developers. GSD v1.50.0-canary.0 is a broader system with more advanced multi-agent orchestration, context engineering, and execution models.

The 74 identified gaps represent a significant opportunity to enhance Big Powers without compromising its core philosophy. The recommended approach is:

1. **Start with context engineering and quality quick wins** (Tier 1) — these provide immediate value with minimal risk.
2. **Add execution speed improvements** (Tier 2) — wave-based parallelism and quick mode significantly improve the user experience.
3. **Incrementally introduce multi-agent patterns** (Tier 3) — start with 5 core agent roles and expand based on user feedback.
4. **Defer strategic investments** (Tier 3-4) — cross-AI delegation, multi-runtime support, and SDK design are long-term goals that should not block near-term improvements.

The phased roadmap above provides a concrete 18-week plan for the first four phases, with a fifth phase for strategic capabilities. Each phase builds on the previous one, minimizing risk while delivering incremental value.
