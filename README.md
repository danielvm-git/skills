**58 agent skills for high-integrity, spec-driven, test-first software development by solo developers.**

`bigpowers` provides a prescriptive, vertical-slice methodology for building software with AI agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor). It bridges the gap between raw LLM capabilities and professional engineering standards.

Published on npm: [bigpowers@1.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bigpowers)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### npm (recommended)

```bash
# One-shot setup — downloads, syncs artifacts, and links skills to your tools
npx bigpowers

# Or install globally and run the setup command anytime
npm install -g bigpowers
bigpowers
```

Both commands sync skill artifacts and link them to Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Cursor (see [Prerequisites](#-prerequisites)).

### From source (contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielvm-git/bigpowers.git && cd bigpowers
npm install          # runs postinstall: sync + link
# or manually:
bash scripts/install.sh
npm run sync
```

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- **Bash**: Required for all scripts.
- **Node.js**: v14+ (required for npm/npx).
- **jq**: (Highly Recommended) Used for robust configuration of tool settings.
- **AI Tools**: One or more of:
  - [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
  - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google/gemini-cli)
  - [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)

## 🔄 Maintenance (Update & Uninstall)

### Update

**npm install:**

```bash
npm update -g bigpowers
bigpowers    # re-sync and refresh symlinks
```

**git clone:**

```bash
git pull
npm run sync
```

*Install uses symlinks — re-running setup refreshes links without duplicating files.*

### Uninstall

**npm install:**

```bash
bash "$(npm root -g)/bigpowers/scripts/install.sh" --uninstall
npm uninstall -g bigpowers
```

**git clone:**

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh --uninstall
```

### Reinstall

```bash
npx bigpowers
# or, if installed globally:
bigpowers
```

## 🏗 The BMAD Lifecycle

Every task in `bigpowers` follows a prescriptive lifecycle (see `SKILL-INDEX.md`):

1.  **Discover**: survey-context, research-first, elaborate-spec.
2.  **Elaborate / Plan**: scope-work, plan-work, slice-tasks.
3.  **Build**: develop-tdd, execute-plan.
4.  **Verify**: verify-work, run-evals — prove it works before review.
5.  **Review / Release**: audit-code, request-review, release-branch.
6.  **Sustain**: stocktake-skills, evolve-skill (benchmark-gated).
