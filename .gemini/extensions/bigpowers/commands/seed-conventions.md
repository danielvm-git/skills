# Seed Conventions

Bootstrap a new project with the AI agent conventions it needs. Run this once at the start of a greenfield project.

## What this creates

- `CLAUDE.md` — Claude Code session config (project-specific)
- `CONVENTIONS.md` — shared rules for all AI agents
- `specs/` — the specs directory where all planning output will live
- `AGENTS.md` — for OpenCode and other agents (optional)
- `GEMINI.md` — for Gemini CLI (optional)

## Interview

Ask the user these questions (one at a time, wait for each answer):

1. **Project name and one-sentence description** — "What is this project? One sentence."

2. **Stack** — "What language, framework, and runtime? (e.g. TypeScript / Next.js / Node 22)"

3. **Commands** — "What commands do you use for: run, test, build, lint? I'll document them so agents know how to verify their work."

4. **Architecture** — "Describe the key modules and their relationships in 1–2 sentences. What are the main moving parts?"

5. **Conventions** — "Any naming conventions, file organization rules, or patterns that every contributor (human or agent) must follow?"

6. **Never-do list** — "What are the hard stops? Things an agent must never touch or do in this project?"

7. **Defensive code categories** — "Which of these apply to your project? (Rate limit / Retry with backoff / Circuit breaker / Timeout / Graceful degradation)"

## Generate files

After the interview, generate:

### `CLAUDE.md`

```markdown
# [Project Name] — Claude Code

Read CONVENTIONS.md before any GitHub or git operation.

## Project
[One sentence description]
Stack: [language, framework, runtime]

## Commands
| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Run    | `[cmd]` |
| Test   | `[cmd]` |
| Build  | `[cmd]` |
| Lint   | `[cmd]` |

## Architecture
[1–2 sentences. Key modules and their relationships.]

## Conventions
- [convention 1]
- [convention 2]

## Never
- [hard stop 1]
- [hard stop 2]

## Agent Rules
- Read specs/ before writing code.
- Write the minimum code that solves the stated problem. Nothing extra.
- Never refactor, rename, or reorganize code outside the task scope.
- Run tests after every change. Show evidence before declaring done.
- One clarifying question beats a wrong assumption baked into 200 lines.
```

### `CONVENTIONS.md`

Use the standard bigpowers CONVENTIONS.md template, filling in the project-specific defensive code categories from the interview.

### `specs/` directory

```bash
mkdir -p specs
echo "# Specs\n\nAll planning documents for this project." > specs/README.md
```

### Verify

- [ ] CLAUDE.md exists and is populated
- [ ] CONVENTIONS.md exists and includes specs/ output convention
- [ ] specs/ directory exists
- [ ] Confirm with user: "Does CLAUDE.md accurately describe your project?"
