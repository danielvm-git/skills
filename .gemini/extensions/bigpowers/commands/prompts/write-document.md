# Write Document (BMAD)

Create high-signal technical documentation that serves as an expert collaborator for both humans and AI. This skill enforces the BMAD principles to prevent context rot and ensure architectural durability.

> **HARD GATE** — Every document must have a clear "Reason for Existence." If a document doesn't provide actionable leverage for a caller or test, do not create it.

## The BMAD Principles

| Principle | Execution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **B**old | Make strong assertions. Define clear boundaries and "Never" rules. No "it might" or "usually." |
| **M**inimal | High-density, low-filler. **Circuit Breaker**: If the file exceeds 300 lines or the session exceeds 20 turns, you MUST run `terse-mode` and compact state before saving. |
| **A**ctionable | Link every doc to a verifiable outcome. **Architectural Docs**: Verify via Gherkin features (`specs/audit/features/`) or grep-based structure checks (`grep -c "pattern" file`) that prove the design's *constraints* are present. |
| **D**urable | Design for the long-term. **Scalability**: Use "Nested Indexing"—root files link to module-level `GEMINI.md` indexes; do not list individual sub-files in the root. |

## Process

### 1. Identify the Artifact Type & Scope

Choose the correct BMAD-BigPowers artifact:
- **Decision Record (ADR)**: For "Why" decisions (saved to `specs/adr/`).
- **Context Map**: For system-wide architectural mapping (`specs/CONTEXT.md`).
- **Technical Guide**: For "How-to" with verification (saved to `<module>/REFERENCE.md`).
- **Behavioral Feature**: Gherkin-style compliance specs (saved to `specs/audit/features/`).

**Cross-Cutting Concerns**: If a doc affects multiple modules, place the authoritative source in the lowest common ancestor directory and use "Delegates" (one-line pointers) in sub-directories to maintain the Single Source of Truth without violating the Stepdown Rule.

### 2. Draft with Semantic Velocity

> **STREAM CONTINUITY** — When writing file content, output in continuous chunks of ~200 lines. Do not pause between sections. Continue immediately until complete. If you need time to think, emit a placeholder heading rather than going silent.

Write the document focusing on "Expert Collaboration":
- **Instructions over Descriptions**: Tell the reader (human or AI) exactly how to interact with the system.
- **Provenance Links**: Link to ADRs, Issues, or Commits to preserve intent.
- **The Stepdown Rule**: Information should descend exactly one level of abstraction. If a root doc needs to explain a leaf-level detail, it must point to a sub-index first.

### 3. Apply the 94% Quality Gate

Before finalizing, audit the document against these red flags:
- [ ] **Filler Language**: Are there pleasantries or "I hope this helps"? (Delete them).
- [ ] **Ambiguity**: Are there "usually," "often," or "it depends" without specific conditions?
- [ ] **Dead Ends**: Does the document end without a "Next Step" or "Verification" command?
- [ ] **Shallow Content**: Does it restate the code without explaining the *intent* or *contracts*?

### 4. Sync and Organize

- **Big Powers Hierarchy**: Place the document in the correct tier (Global -> Project -> Sub-directory).
- **Nested Indexing**: If adding a module-level doc, ensure the module's `GEMINI.md` is updated. If the module's index is new, add it to the root `GEMINI.md`.
- **Sync**: Run `scripts/sync-skills.sh` if the document is a `SKILL.md` or affects generated artifacts.

## Rules

- **Minimalism is a requirement**: If a document can be a 5-line table, do not make it a 5-line essay.
- **Verifiable outcomes**: Every technical document must include at least one `verify:` command. For architecture, this can be a `grep` or `run_shell_command` that validates the existence of required files or patterns.
- **No speculative docs**: Do not write documentation for features that do not exist yet unless explicitly doing `elaborate-spec`.
