# Verify Work

> **HARD GATE** — No story is "done" until its `## Verification Script` from RELEASE-PLAN.md is confirmed by the user or agent with evidence.

Review answers "is the code good?"; Verify answers "does the built thing do what was promised?"

## Process

1. Read the story's `## Verification Script` from `specs/RELEASE-PLAN.md`.
2. **Cold-start smoke** (if app): stop server, clear caches, boot from scratch.
3. Run mechanical gates: build → typecheck → lint → full test suite (commands from CLAUDE.md).
4. **Step-by-step UAT**: one user-observable action at a time; record pass/fail.
5. **Gaps loop**: failed steps → log as Gaps → feed back to `plan-work` → re-verify until pass.

## UAT dialogue

- Pass: user confirms `yes` / `next` / `ok` per step.
- Fail: capture expected vs actual; do not mark story done.

## Verify

→ verify: `grep -c "Verification Script" specs/RELEASE-PLAN.md | awk '{if($1>0) print "OK"; else print "MISSING"}'`

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for cold-start and gaps template.

# Verify Work — Reference

## Cold-start smoke

```bash
# Example — adapt to project CLAUDE.md
pkill -f "<dev-server>" 2>/dev/null || true
rm -rf .next/cache node_modules/.cache 2>/dev/null || true
<run command> &
sleep 3 && curl -sf http://localhost:<port>/health || echo "BOOT FAIL"
```

## Gaps template

```markdown
## Gaps (verify-work)

| Step | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | ... | ... | FAIL |
```

Feed gaps to `plan-work` as new steps with verify commands, then re-run verify-work.
