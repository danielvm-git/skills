## Status Legend

| Icon | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ Active | SKILL.md exists and is usable |
| 📋 Planned | Designed but not yet implemented |
| 🔄 Refactoring | Active but under revision |
| ⚠️ Deprecated | Will be removed in a future release |

## Naming Convention Notes

All skills follow `verb-noun` kebab-case (ADR-0001). Documented exceptions:
- `terse-mode` — adjective-noun; retained for clarity
- `visual-dashboard` — adjective-noun; retained for clarity

## How to Update

1. Every new skill: add a row here before publishing.
2. After any change: bump "Last updated" and run `bash scripts/sync-skills.sh`.

→ verify: `find . -maxdepth 2 -name "SKILL.md" | grep -v ".git\|.cursor\|.gemini" | wc -l`
