# Research First

> **HARD GATE** — Do NOT implement until prior art is searched. Minimum outcome: adopt, extend, compose, or build — with evidence.

## Process

1. Read `specs/SCOPE.md`, `specs/RELEASE-PLAN.md`, and the current task statement.
2. Search in order: this repo → bigpowers skills (`search-skills`) → package registries → web docs.
3. For each candidate: note name, URL/path, fit (adopt | extend | compose | build).
4. Append `## Prior Art` to the active spec (SCOPE.md or story in RELEASE-PLAN.md).

## Outcome matrix

| Verdict | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **adopt** | Use as-is; link in plan; no new code |
| **extend** | Wrap or configure existing solution |
| **compose** | Chain existing skills/modules |
| **build** | New implementation — justify why others failed |

## Verify

→ verify: `grep -c "Prior Art" specs/SCOPE.md specs/RELEASE-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null | awk '{s+=$1} END {if(s>0) print "OK"; else print "MISSING"}'`

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for search commands and registry checklist.
